              Motivated and ambitious Computer Graphics graduate from the Faculty of
              Technical Sciences at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia. Possess
              strong communication skills with fluency in English and Serbian.
              Keen to pursue a career in the beautiful world of 3D, VFX, Compositing, Architectural Visualization and more.
              As a person who is immersed, passionate and focused on transforming ideas into real projects within the realm of digital creations
              whether I'm working in Houdini, Nuke or any kind of software there is always going to be a problem ready to be solved and I'm all for it.
              When I'm taking a break from the 3D environment I usually take my time to work with web design and development.
              A small experience in web design and development can make a huge difference in terms of detecting small details in compositing, texturing or even modeling.
              It helped me understand more about color terminology as a whole and small details can change the whole perspective of the scene.
              So let's embark on a visual journey together and create something extraordinary.

              Using the latest technology concerning web design and development, 
              I've created multiple websites, applications and designs. 
              The main tools that I use for this field of work are mostly HTML, CSS JavaScript and React for development and the most popular sofware for web design Figma. 
              Sometimes I will use a framework such as Next.js as an exchange for React, Bootstrap and Tailwind for basic CSS. 
              As for the design park, I've always used Figma as a reliable software for web design and presentation.
              All of my projects are available on <a class="section-text-links" href="https://github.com/aleksa1997">GitHub</a> and

            <h3 class="section-heading">Houdini/Nuke</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              I've always wondered how some of the special effects are made such as large oceans in Star Wars, dragon fire in Hobbit or lava in Jurassic World. 
              That's where Houdini was mentioned a lot, as a lot of people claim to be a very hard experience to learn it is indeed a fact. 
              But once you get used to it, the software just keeps on giving and it's rewarding. 
              For a couple of months, I've been doing just that learning, practicing and tweaking a small portion of the software. 
              Creating water simulations, dust storms and sci-fi lasers, texturing and rendering is just the beginning of something special. 
              But if you are using Houdini then there is always another great software for compositing, and that is where Nuke comes in. 
              Nuke is an industry-standard tool for post-production such as compositing and creating appealing visual effects alongside Fusion Studio and After Effects. 
              As a node-based software like Houdini, it's very easy to change, modify and control your scene. 
              Alongside Houdini and Nuke, I like to combine other software such as Adobe Audition and After Effects. 
              Audition for sound editing and After Effects for combining whole composition with the sound and rendering. 
              Here is a little preview of my projects in Houdini and Nuke.

            <h3 class="section-heading">Architectural Visualization</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              Architectural Visualization will always be special for me when it comes to 3D visualization. 
              Because of Archviz, I fell in love with the world of 3D, and most importantly visualization. 
              My dad at the time was working on an interior project for a local coffee shop and that's when it clicked for me. 
              As much as I love interior work exterior is the one that inspired me to create more and more innovative projects which sometimes can be challenging. 
              All of my Archviz projects are made in 3ds Max and post-produced in Adobe Photoshop. But there is always room for improvement, and there is when Unreal Engine kicks in. 
              The future of Archviz is in the Unreal Engine's hands, and that's why I'm still learning and improving in this field of work. 
              Some of the work is still in progress but will come out very very soon.  
              All of my projects are on my <a class="section-text-links" href="https://aleksa_stojsic.artstation.com/" target="_blank">Artstation</a > page.

            <h3 class="section-heading">Blender</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              We all know the existence of Blender. Free and open-source 3D software is used by millions worldwide. 
              Easy to use, Blender was must must-learn program for me when it comes to 3D. 
              Creating cartoonish scenes and models was like a breath of fresh air when it came to creativity and just having fun. 
              My personal favorite things to create in Blender are isometric scenes, whether that be a room or a building. 
              All of my Blender projects can be viewed at
